Management:
-----------
- Planning
- budget

Equipement:
-----------
- PCB designer
- Nordic development kit NRF52840
- Nordic Bluetooth dongle and Nordic central device

how to order electronics components?
where to print the PCB?

Component:
----------
- Sensor for Voltage generator
- Interrupt generator
- ADC
- Accelerometer
- Connection between board NRF52840 and extension board
- Connection between sensor and extension board
- Supply of the extension board

The precision of the components must be defined

Communication:
--------------
- Computer and NRF52840 BLE with bandwidth
- SPI ADC and NRF52840
- Accelerometer and NRF52840

Programmation:
--------------
- Definition of scenarios	\_ Same code with bare metal and Zephyr
- Data acquisition		/
- Base bare metal
- Base Zephyr
- To display the result

Where the result must be displayed?

To Try to be able to use the scenario easily with different operating system.
To Try to be able to use the system with different processor.

tests:
------
- Interruption latency time
- Power consumption		-- How to procede
- Comparison between bare metal and Zephyr
