This project is my Bachelor's thesis written in 2017 when I was a Bachelor student in embedded system. The project was 
realised at semiconductor in Norway.

Abstract
---------
Nordic Semiconductor is interested in the possibility of using a RTOS with its products. Therefore, the
purpose of this project is to determine the behaviour and performance of Zephyr RTOS using a high
traffic Bluetooth Low Energy. In a second time, the behaviour of Zephyr RTOS is compared with
Nordic SoftDevice and Software Development Kit which are used as reference value for analyse the
performance. To determine the behaviour, different measurements as power consumption, interrupt
latency and BLE communication behaviour are performed. The results with Zephyr RTOS and
SoftDevice and Nordic SDK are finally compared to evaluate if Zephyr RTOS could be an option for
Nordic Semiconductor. The final results are convincing and show that Zephyr RTOS is a good option
to take into consideration.
